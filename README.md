Portfolio showcasing cybersecurity and digital forensics projects
# Portfolio Summary

Welcome to my E-Portfolio! My name is Katie. In the first module, I have shared definitions and concepts of cybercrime. In each module, I have described learning outcomes for each subject in terms of:

- Digital forensics  
- Computer crime investigation process  
- Digital forensic tools  
- Legal admissibility  
- Prevention strategies  
- Understanding criminal minds or motivations  
- Digital forensic knowledge  
- Law enforcement sanctioning  

There are a wide variety of essential software programs that could help during the cybercrime investigation process. I hope the files provided in this E-Portfolio give a great example of how these programs can be utilized professionally with law enforcement strategies according to current laws, which vary state by state.
